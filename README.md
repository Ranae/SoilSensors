# SoilSensors

This is what we need to take soil data from the datastation to .out files for Excel.  First the Excel files need to be saved as csvs.  Then all the csvs need to be saved in the same folder that R is using for the working directory.  Right now the date in the file names needs to me updated, but I think I can change that.  Then run the code and we should end up with four output files, although the code will need to be updated when new loggers come online.  Wasn't sure if we should process Sutherland files at the same time, so I left them out for now.
